		Important HTML comment rules / tips:
		- Syntax: <!-- comment text -->
		- Do not use "--" inside comments (e.g., <!-- bad -- comment --> is invalid)
		- Comments are visible in the source; do NOT include secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.)
		- HTML comments are not nested: <!-- outer <!-- inner --> outer --> doesn't work
		- Legacy conditional comments (IE) exist (e.g., <!--[if IE]> ... <![endif]-->) but are deprecated
