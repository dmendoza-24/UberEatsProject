This project was a short 3-hour creation for an Uber Eats "Verified Kitchens" webpage. The idea is to allow users to reliably find verified stores on Uber Eats, helping to resolve issues like duplicate menus and sketchy order processing. The project consists of beginner HTML and CSS work, created by Cayman Powell and Daniel Mendoza.

To see the resulting webpage for yourself, you can download the files and open "front_page.html" in your browser of choice. You can also visit additional pages by clicking on "Contact" and "Find Verified Kitchens Near You."
